# Telegram-Group-Creator
A Python script to bulk-create Telegram supergroups. It uses Telethon and prompts the user for their API keys. It asks for the number of groups, a base name, an optional list of members to add, and a log channel. It creates each group, generates an invite link, and sends a log message with details for each success.
